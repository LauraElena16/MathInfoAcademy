# MathInfoAcademy

## Overview
**MathInfo Academy** is a web application that provides a solution for organizing the activity materials and grades and walking directions in the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of Bucharest. 

This application was build as a final project for my undergraduate degree in Economic Cybernetics at the Faculty of Administrations and Business from the University of Bucharest. For further details about the application I uploaded a PDF with my degree thesis and the link to the file is [this one](https://github.com/LauraElena16/MathInfoAcademy/blob/main/Licenta_TascaLaura-Elena.pdf). The thesis is written in Romanian.

## Technologies

The technologies used on the backend side are the following:
- Python
- Django
- MySQL database
- Docker

The frontend side of the application was build using these technologies:
- HTML, CSS & JS
- Bootstrap

## Functionalities
For a better view of the functionalities provided by the app I created a YouTube video that can be found [here](https://youtu.be/2VyhX2xZI7k).

### Directions within the faculty's building
Both guests and logged in users can access the Directions page, where they enter a start point and a destination and they are given directions to follow in order to reach the chosen destination starting from the specified start point.

### Activity
Students can see the individual activities for each subject that they are enrolled to. They can view and download the pdf materials for the activities that were uploaded by the teachers as well. Teachers, on the other hand, can view the activities that they are responsible for and upload or delete materials for each of these.

### Grades
The grades section provides an intuitive view over the student's academic situation. A student can see the final grade for each of their subjects, as well as the grades, max grades for all activities in a subject, along with the associated credits. Moreover, teachers can see in this section a list of students and change the max grade for each activity. They can also set the grade of each student enrolled in their activities.
